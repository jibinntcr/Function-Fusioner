# Functions

**Key Concepts:**

- **Function Flexibility:** Dart supports passing functions as arguments, enabling adaptable and reusable code.
- **General-Purpose Functions:** The `processList` function demonstrates this flexibility by accepting different operations, making it versatile for various tasks.
- **Custom Operations:** New functionalities can be easily incorporated by defining new functions, promoting code modularity and extensibility.
- **Clear Output:** The program's output facilitates understanding by explicitly showing the input and output for each list element.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **`processList` Function:**
   - Takes a list of numbers and an operation function as inputs.
   - Iterates through the list using a `for` loop.
   - Applies the provided operation to each number.
   - Prints the input and its transformed result for clarity.

2. **Operation Functions:**
   - `doubleNumber` doubles a number.
   - `squareNumber` squares a number.
   - New operations can be easily added by defining additional functions.

**Insights and Extensions:**

- **Function Composition:** This technique can be used to create more complex operations by combining multiple functions.
- **Error Handling:** The program could be enhanced by incorporating error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.
- **Real-World Applications:** This approach is applicable to various scenarios such as:
   - Filtering lists based on criteria
   - Sorting lists using different algorithms
   - Performing calculations on list elements
   - Transforming data structures

**Key Takeaways:**

- Leverage function flexibility in Dart to create adaptable and reusable code.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, modular functions for better organization.
- Provide clear output to aid understanding and debugging.
- Consider error handling and real-world applications to enhance program robustness and practicality.
